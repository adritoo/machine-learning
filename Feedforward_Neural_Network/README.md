# Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)

The purpose of this project is to develop our first FFNN algorithm.
We will use `numpy` library to complet our job.

# Files
There are two files in our repository:
```bash
lab1.py #it contains our algorithm 
```
```bash
data_ffnn_3classes.txt #contains our data for training.
```

## Before starting
To run the app localy you will need to install `numpy`  & `matplotlib`
```bash
py pip install numpy
py pip install matplotlib
```

## How to start ?
Clone the repository on your computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adritoo/machine-learning.git
cd Feedforward_Neural_Network
```
Run with your terminal
```bash
py lab1.py
```
